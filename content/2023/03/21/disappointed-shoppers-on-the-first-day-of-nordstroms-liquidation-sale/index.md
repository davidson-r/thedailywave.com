The highly anticipated first day of Nordstrom's liquidation sale in Canada left some shoppers underwhelmed by the discounts. Despite seeing long lineups outside many locations, customers found that most items were only marked down by a measly five per cent.

Nordstrom's decision to exit the Canadian market, including closing all of its department stores and Nordstrom Rack locations, was announced earlier this month. The liquidation sale began after the company received approval from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Monday.

While a Nordstrom spokesperson confirmed that "select categories and products" were marked down up to 20 per cent, many shoppers were still disappointed by the lack of significant discounts. The company is also liquidating its furniture, fixtures, and equipment from its stores, with all goods from third-party sellers already removed.

The closure of Nordstrom's Canadian online store earlier this month, coupled with the liquidation of physical stores, will impact around 2,500 employees.

The liquidation sale is set to end by late June, marking the end of Nordstrom's eight-year run in the Canadian market. CEO Erik Nordstrom cited a lack of profitability in the country as the reason for the company's decision to exit.
