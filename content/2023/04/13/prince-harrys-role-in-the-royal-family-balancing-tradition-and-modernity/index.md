Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has been making headlines since stepping down from his working royal role and moving to the United States with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. Despite his departure from the Royal Family, Harry has remained in the public eye, securing a series of lucrative production deals with major companies such as Netflix and Spotify.

However, as reputational management expert Edward Coram James has suggested, Harry's links to the Royal Family are still his primary source of currency. For the moment, his birthright and royal connections are what make him relevant in the public eye. While his production deals may have been facilitated by his status as a member of the Royal Family, it is ultimately the quality and success of his projects that will determine his long-term success.

Coram James argues that attending the Coronation is one way for Harry to maintain his relevance and connection to the Royal Family. While his attendance is primarily a ceremonial duty, it also serves as an opportunity for Harry to demonstrate his commitment to tradition and balance that with his desire to innovate and pursue his own interests.

At the same time, Harry's attendance at the Coronation could also help repair strained personal relationships within the Royal Family, particularly with his brother, Prince William, and his father, Prince Charles. As Harry continues to navigate his role in the Royal Family and pursue his own interests, finding this balance between tradition and modernity will be key to his success and relevance in the public eye.

Ultimately, Harry's legacy as a member of the Royal Family will depend not just on his birthright, but also on his ability to make meaningful contributions and leave a lasting impact on the world.
